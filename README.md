1.	Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Version control helps in keeping track of changes in code over time. It also allows multiple people to work on the same project without messing things up. If a mistake is made, you can go back to an earlier version of the code.GitHub is popular because it makes it easy to store, share, and manage code online. It also helps teams collaborate, review changes, and work on different versions of a project without any confusions.

2.	Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps, and what are some of the important decisions you must make during this process?
 First of all a repository (repo) is like a folder that stores your project and its history in GitHub.
Steps to create a new repo:
1.	Go to GitHub.com and log in if you have an account or sign up if you don’t have an account.
2.	Click the "+" button (top-right) which is called" Repository."
3.	Give your repo a name.
4.	 You can choose public (anyone can see) or private (only you and your team can see).
5.	Add a README file (optional, but useful).
6.	Click Create repository to finish.

3.	Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?

What to include in a good README?
•	Project name and description- A README file should have a project name and project description to make it easy for a person to understand what the project was all about.
•	Installation steps – It should have steps on how to set the project up.
•	How to use the project- It should have description on how to use the project and maintain.
•	Contributors – It should explain the on the people who worked on the project and who also contributed to it.
•	License – The project should be licensed if possible or neccesary.

4.	Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?
                        
Feature	                                       Public Repo	                                       Private Repo
Who can see?	                            Everyone	                                    Only you and invited people
Who can contribute?	                 Anyone (if allowed)	                   Only invited people
Best for?	                                   Open-source projects	                  Personal or company projects
Pros	                                  More visibility, free for open-source	 More security, controlled access
Cons	Less privacy, possible unwanted changes	Limited access, less collaboration with outsiders


5.	Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?                
A commit is a saved change in your project. It helps track updates over time.
Steps to make your first commit:
1.	Open your repo.
2.	Add a file (a README or code file).
3.	Click Commit changes.
4.	Write a short message ("Added README").
5.	Click Commit.

6.	How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.
A branch is like a copy of your project where you can make changes without affecting the main version.
How it works?
•	Main branch (often called main or master) is the main project.
•	New branches are created to test new features or fix bugs.
•	After testing, the new branch can be merged into the main branch.


7.	Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?
A pull request (PR) is a request to merge changes from one branch to another. It lets other team members review the changes before they are added to the main project.
Steps to create a pull request:
1.	Push your changes to GitHub.
2.	Go to your repo and click New Pull Request.
3.	Add a description and submit the request.
4.	Team members review and give feedback.
5.	If everything is good, the PR is merged into the main branch.
Why is it useful?
•	Prevents mistakes.
•	Allows discussion and review before merging changes.


8.	Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?
Forking: Creating a copy of someone else’s project in your GitHub account. You can make changes without affecting the original project.
Cloning: Downloading a copy of a repository to your computer.
When to fork?
•	When contributing to open-source projects.
•	When you want to modify a repo without permission from the owner.
When to clone?
•	When you need a local copy to work on but don’t want to change ownership.


9.	Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.

Issues are used to track bugs, tasks, and feature requests.
Project boards help organize and manage tasks visually.
How they help:
•	Issues allow discussions about problems.
•	Labels help categorize issues ("bug", "enhancement").
•	Project boards organize work using columns like "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done".

10.	Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?
Common challenges:
•	Merge conflicts (when two people change the same part of a file).
•	Forgetting to pull before pushing (causing conflicts).
•	Bad commit messages (making history unclear).
•	Not using branches (leading to messy main code).
Best practices:
•	Write clear commit messages (e.g., "Fixed login bug").
•	Use branches for new features and bug fixes.
•	Pull before pushing to avoid conflicts.
•	Review code with pull requests before merging.
